# Transport Company Database Project
## Grade: 17.6/20
This project was conducted in the **second year, first semester** as part of our database course. We chose to create a simulated database for a transport company, along with the development of its UML diagram.

## Overview

In this project, we developed a comprehensive database system for managing information related to transport companies operating in Portugal, regardless of whether they are headquartered internationally. The system was designed to manage essential data such as company details, warehouses, vehicles, employees, and customer orders. The database allows for efficient tracking and management of various operations within the transport company.

## Features

  - Manages information related to company buildings and warehouses, including location, contact details, operating hours, storage capacity, and security levels.

- **Employee and Driver Management**

  - Tracks employee information, including personal details, job positions, qualifications, salary, and hiring date. Specifically manages drivers by linking them to their respective vehicles and driving categories.

- **Order and Shipment Management**

  - Handles customer orders, including order tracking, payment status, and delivery details. Manages shipments and routes, ensuring efficient delivery with real-time tracking.

- **Customer and Complaint Management**
  - Stores customer information, including order history and payment details. Manages customer complaints, providing feedback and resolution timelines.

## UML Diagram

The project also involved the creation of a UML diagram to visually represent the structure and relationships within the database. This diagram was refined with the assistance of AI tools like ChatGPT, which helped identify potential improvements and optimizations in the model.
